Age of Rage
===========

Verse 1 (to be written)

This time the world is mine
Living by what you have defined
This time the world is mine
...
You could dream, while I had to fight

New skin made of my design
Living a new way, I redefine
New skin made of my design
...
It's my dream and for it, I will fight

Verse 2 (to be written)

This time the world is mine
Living by what you have defined
This time the world is mine
...
You could dream, while I had to fight

New skin made of my design
Living a new way, I redefine
New skin made of my design
...
It's my dream and for it, I will fight

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

(Is it all the same?)
I've made the same mistakes
Leaving it behind just brings me back to the same place
(It's too much to take)
But despite the way it may seem
I've become so much more than I ever thought I could be
