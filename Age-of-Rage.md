Age of Rage
===========

Verse 1 (to be written)

This time the world is mine
Living by what you have defined
This time the world is mine
You could dream, while I had to fight

New skin made of my design
Living a new way, I redefine
New skin made of my design
It's my dream, and I will fight

Verse 2 (to be written)

This time the world is mine
Living by what you have defined
This time the world is mine
You could dream, while I had to fight

New skin made of my design
Living a new way, I redefine
New skin made of my design
It's my dream, and I will fight

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

(Is it all the same?)
I've made the same mistakes
I'm leaving it behind, just me back to the same place
(Who is to blame?)
Despite the way it may seem
I've become so much more than I ever thought I could be
