Age of Rage
===========

I break away, it's all the same believed the lies you told to me, I knew all along
Blah Blah Blah... blah blah blah
I have now found a way to see the things you said to me for what they are, still I ____
Blah blah blah... blah blah blah
It seems the day you walked away I found a way to let my dreams come so can I fade
Blah blah blah... blah blah blah

Nothings' real by design
Living by what you have defined
And you know that it's not what I had in mind
You could dream, while I had to fight

New skin made of my design
Living a new way, I redefine
New skin made of my design
...
It's my dream and for it, I will fight

Verse 2 (to be written)

This time the world is mine
Living by what you have defined
This time the world is mine
...
You could dream, while I had to fight

New skin made of my design
Living a new way, I redefine
New skin made of my design
...
It's my dream and for it, I will fight

... break (dj)

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

(Is it all the same?)
I've made the same mistakes
Leaving it behind just brings me back to the same place

.. break (dj)

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

Define, redefine

(Is it all the same?)
I've made the same mistakes
Leaving it behind just brings me back to the same place
(It's too much to take)
But despite the way it may seem
I've become so much more than I ever thought I could be
