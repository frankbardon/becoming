Dreaming (Brian)
================

There's no solution to my confusion  
Don't feed my obsession with constant supression  
Compulsive behavior of an unpromised savior  
Flooded with lies through insecure eyes  

Unwanted guests prey on your mind  
As you're sleeping  
Stay for a while, everything's fine  
When you're dreaming  

Drown by blind faith  
Drown into a dream state  
Crazy trips of chaos and fear  
Crazy trips that keep you here  
Haunting, eerie  
Chilling to the bone  
Together as one  
Still all alone
