First Born
==========

Joe: Living with un-realistic expectations as the first born

It's what I have believed in with all of my might
Heart, spirit, body and mind. A little bit
  of everything I have, and all I have to give

I have never felt so much love in my life
Hopes, dreams, aspirations, everything just felt so right
A memory, abandoned, destroyed right in front of me

I blame you

I can't contain these thoughts that are racing through my mind
I cherish this life with which I am blessed
And those behind me who make me what I want to be

Except for you


Joe's Part
----------
Opening my eyes for the very first time
To the path of what they call a victimless crime
Where do they expecting what they call perfection
Pardon my interjection, but this shit needs a new complexion
What we need is contraception, change of tradition... Teach you a lesson
Write things we can say today can change one's world
