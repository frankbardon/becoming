First Born
==========

It's what I have believed in with all of my might
Heart, spirit, body and mind. A little bit
  of everything I have, and all I have to give

I have never felt so much love in my life
Hopes, dreams, aspirations, everything just felt so right
A memory, abandoned, destroyed right in front of me

I blame you

I can't contain these thoughts that are racing through my mind
I cherish this life with which I am blessed
And those behind me who make me what I want to be

Except for you


Brian's Original
----------------

And I never felt so much love in my life
Never felt something could be so right
Just to have all of my hopes and dreams
Destroyed in front of me
Only a memory
That stains my brain
I blame, I blame, I blame you.
