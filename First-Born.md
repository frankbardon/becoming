First Born
==========

It's what I have believed in with all of my might  
Heart, spirit, body and mind. A little bit  
  of everything I have, and all I have to give  

I have never felt so much love in my life  
Hopes, dreams, aspirations, everything just felt so right  
A memory, abandoned, destroyed right in front of me  

I blame you  

I can't contain these thoughts that are racing through my mind  
I cherish this life with which I am blessed  
And those behind me who make me what I want to be  

Except for you
