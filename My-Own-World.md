My Own World
============

Give me my death
Give me my life
Easy my mind
Watch me take flight
If I fly too high
Bring me back home
Show me how it used to be
Take my hand and go
If I leave this show forever
Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I think if all was different
Maybe I'd be strong
So come into your own demise
See yourself through my eyes
Caught behind a wall of shame
Hidden waves that go insane
Push it down and throw it out
Save your shit for someone else
Don't need your breath
Don't need your hole
Don't need you
In my own world
