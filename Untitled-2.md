==========

Are you the desperate type?  
The streets and crowd  
Just look around  
You're not the only one I see  

I guess you had me trapped  

If I asked, could you see me as a friend?  
Or am I a prize? Won, dropped and left for dead  
Would you care if it hurt?  
Or am I a prize? Hooked, reeled and put to work  

Am I worth a damn to you?  
Or were you hoping to be saved?  
It's a desperate attempt at redemption  
Fuck it, I guess I'm to blame
