Remember My Name
================

Deep inside you're pounding hard  
My sweet stare is no safe bet  
There's no excuse for my last  
The sick thoughts come again  
I can kill at will  
And accept your praise  
Then i'll spit you out  
And you'll remember my name  
Roll over, you make me ill  
Quit the bitchin' we're almost done  
I can't tell you where I'm going  
But I know when I'll come  
I'm in your mind  
You'll never let me go  
Didn't mean to hurt you  
I can't help it though  
And you'll remember my name  
You'll remember my name  
Yes, you'll remember my name  
You'll remember my name
