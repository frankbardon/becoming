I Only Wanted To Be
===================

This contant contact, we're splitting hairs  
Deciding to stay, to alay our fears  
No more cancelling care to stay what we are  
When who we are suffers if we go too far  

Our perfect vision  
See only strangers  
In friends we've known  
The ____ they've shown  
It's commendable  
Never thought I was worth it  
But now I can prove I was  

I will not sacrifice you to be who I am  
I'll become to me I wanted to be  
Back when things were simple  
When I could let things go  
Before I became so bitter  
The person that I wanted to be
