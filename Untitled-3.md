Untitled 3
==========

You turned away
Maybe for the best
I can't live in the wake
Of the steps that we take
To forget about the rest

What can I say?
Maybe for the best
If promises were kept
There'd be something left
But you settled for the rest

I'm only half of what I could be
With time, it narrows down
Maybe...
