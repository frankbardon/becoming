Bury My Pain
============

I try
God knows I try
To hold back
Hold back the fear
Hold back the pain
Hold back the anger
Asleep in my brain

But i'll let it go
Go away
Then i'll fly
Fly away
Away
Where no one knows my name

So take my blood
Wash it down
Sleep will come
With a single sound

Never again to call your name
Buried
My forgotten pain
Buried down
Gone away

I wish you'd feel my hell today
To sleep with love forever gone
Buried my pain
Buried in song
