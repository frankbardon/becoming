Define, Redefined
=================

I break away, it's all the same believed the lies you told to me, I knew all along
I have now found a way to see the things you said to me for what they are but still I fall
...
It seems the day you walked away I found a way to let my dreams come so can I fade

Nothing to your design
Living by what you have defined
And you know that it's not what I had in mind
You could dream, while I had to fight

Something to my design
Without judgement, I redefine
And you know that it's just what I had in mind
(In my mind, sample)

You define, I redefine
You define, I redefine

()
I've made the same mistakes
Leaving it behind just brings me back to the same place
()
But despite the way it may seem
I've become so much more than I ever thought I could be

You define, I redefine
You define, I redefine

()
I've made the same mistakes
Leaving it behind just brings me back to the same place
()
But despite the way it may seem
I've become so much more than I ever thought I could be

- Need to write complex outro
  - Repeated... fake lyrics
