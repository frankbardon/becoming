Before I Throw My Life Away
===========================

Did you know sometimes I watch you when you sleep?
Believing that, alone, was precious
Lying so still, now here's someone
That would only dream of me
Perhaps I'm nieve, that's just me

When I wake from this nightmare
I hear you say
"Don't take my life away"
Just give me one reason
For one more day
Before I throw my life away
