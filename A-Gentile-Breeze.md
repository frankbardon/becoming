A Gentile Breeze
===============

Let me take you, if I may
Take you on a little ride
Some of you may get a laugh
Some of you may cry
Where the air is cool, the lights are low
On a gentle breeze, away we'll go. Flying
All senses numb, then you begin
Somehow to touch your past
Can't remember what you see
Yet, you wish you could forget
You try and try, but can't relax
With a gentle breeze against your back
Don't worry angel, you should know
On a gentle breeze, away we'll go. Flying
Should I take you far away?
Or should we bring you back?
With a gentle breeze against your back
Driven by your madness
Strange that I would know
On a gentle breeze, away we'll go. Flying
