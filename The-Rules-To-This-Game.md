The Rules to this Game
======================

This empty place has become bearable  
Tolerable, as I guess all things become  
The rules to this game, so often changed  
No longer more comprehendable  
  Than words on this page  
  Read, blinded with rage  
  Scared of what I see  
  And the feelings it'll bring to me  

I never wanted to me anything like this  
I don't know what I've become
