Wind
====

Wish I could feel you so far away  
The wind blows memories  
Whispers your name  
The stars shine for you  
Like I once did  
I watch the rain to kill some time  
As I watch, I feel just fine  
Feel the drops beat with my heart  
Every drop, a brand new start  

My weakness, my sould wearing so thin  
Pondering life, listening to the wind
