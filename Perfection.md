Perfection
==========

Maybe one day i'll be perfect  
  Today is not that day  
I'll live out the hours  
  The reward? another tomorrow  
  Where I can do it all again  

This contant build
The inevitable fall  
  Will lead me to my fate  
But my fate is my own  
  And I define, redefine  
  And determine what is great
